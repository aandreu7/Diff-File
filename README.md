# Diff-File
This C++ project calculates the edit distance between two strings (which are read from files) using dynamic programming. It computes the minimum number of edit operations (insert, delete, replace) required to convert one string into another, and shows the result in a specific order, ensuring that consecutive operations of same type are grouped.
